# Food Delivery Website

Welcome to the Food Delivery Website Frontend project! This project was developed during my internship at Fringale, where I worked as a frontend designer. The website aims to provide a seamless and visually appealing experience for users looking to order food online. It includes various features such as home, about, menu, cart, order, popular items, login page, newsletter, and blogs.

- Home: The landing page of the website, featuring a welcoming layout with an overview of the services.
- About: A section providing information about the company, its mission, and values.
- Menu: A detailed list of available food items with descriptions, images, and prices.
- Cart: A feature that allows users to add, view, and modify items they wish to purchase.
